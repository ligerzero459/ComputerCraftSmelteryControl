ComputerCraft Smeltery Control
===================

Welcome to a new, interesting way to control your smeltery with ComputerCraft. The "Smeltery Control" program is designed to automatically check for new ores being placed into the tank, calculate the total number of blocks able to be poured with the number of left over ingots as the remainder and pour all of those out automatically.

Version 1.0 currently uses only one computer, but version 2.0 will feature monitoring that will require a second computer.

To install smeltery control script, start up you ComputerCraft computer and enter `pastebin get rP8pMQw6 setup.lua`. That will download the `setup.lua` script. Run `setup.lua` and the remaining files will be pulled from the repo.
